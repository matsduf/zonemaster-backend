# Architecture

The Zonemaster *Backend* is a system for performing domain health checks and
keeping records of performed domain health checks.

A Zonemaster *Backend* system consists of at least three components: a
single *Database*, a single *Worker* and one or more *Web backends*.


## Components

### Database

The *Database* stores health check requests and results. The *Backend*
architecture is oriented around a single central *Database*.


### Worker

A Zonemaster *Worker* is a daemon that picks up *test* requests from the
*Database*, runs them using the *Zonemaster Engine* library, and records the results back
to the *Database*. A single *Worker* may handle several requests concurrently.
The *Backend* architecture supports a single *Worker* interacting with a single *Database*.

### Web backend

A Zonemaster *Web backend* is a daemon providing a JSON-RPC interface for
recording *test* requests in the *Database* and fetching *test* results from the
*Database*. The *Backend* architecture supports multiple *Web backends*
interacting with the same *Database*.
