# API

## Purpose

This document describes the JSON-RPC API provided by the Zonemaster *Web backend*.
This API provides means to check the health of domains and to fetch domain health reports.
Health checks are called *tests* in Zonemaster lingo.


## Protocol

This API is implemented using [JSON-RPC 2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

JSON-RPC request objects are accepted in the body of HTTP POST requests to any path.
The HTTP request must contain the header `Content-Type: application/json`.

All JSON-RPC request and response objects have the keys `"jsonrpc"`, `"id"` and `"method"`.
For details on these, refer to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.


### Deviations from JSON-RPC 2.0

* The `"jsonrpc"` property is not checked.
* The error code -32603 is used for invalid arguments, as opposed to the dedicated error code -32602.
* When standard error codes are used, the accompanying messages are not the standard ones.


### Notes on the JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation

* Extra top-level properties in request objects are allowed but ignored.
* Extra properties in the `"params"` object are allowed for some methods but ignored for others.
* Error messages from the API should be considered sensitive as they sometimes leak details about the internals of the application and the system.
* The error code -32601 is used when the `"method"` property is missing, rather than the perhaps expected error code -32600.


## Request handling

When a method expects a string argument but receives an array or an object,
the value may be interpreted as something like `"ARRAY(0x1a2d1d0)"` or `"HASH(0x1a2d2c8)"`.

When a method expects a boolean argument, any kind of value is accepted.
A number of values are interpreted as false: `false`, `null`, `""`, `"0"` and any number equal to zero.
Everything else is interpreted as true.

When a method expects an integer arguments, numbers encoded in strings are also accepted and used transparently,
and numbers with fractions are rounded to the nearest integer.

For details on when a *test* are performed after it's been requested,
see the [architecture documentation](Architecture.md).


## Error reporting

If the request object is invalid JSON, an error with code `-32700` is reported.

If no method is specified or an invalid method is specified, an error with code `-32601` is reported.

All error states that occur after the RPC method has been identified are reported as internal errors with code `-32603`.


## Privilege levels

This API provides three classes of methods:

* *Unrestricted* methods are available to anyone with access to the API.
* *Authenticated* methods have parameters for username and API key credentials.
* *Administrative* methods require that the connection to the API is opened from localhost (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`).


## Data types

This sections describes a number of data types used in this API. Each data type
is based on a JSON data type, but additionally imposes its own restrictions.


### Batch id

Basic data type: number

An positive integer.

The unique id of a *batch*.


### Domain name

Basic data type: string

1. If the string is a single character, that character must be `.`.

2. The length of the string must not be greater than 254 characters.

3. When the string is split at `.` characters (after IDNA conversion,
   if needed), each component part must be at most 63 characters long.

> Note: Currently there are no restrictions on what characters that are allowed.


### DS info

Basic data type: object

Properties:

* `"digest"`: A string, required. Either 40 or 64 hexadecimal characters (case insensitive).
* `"algorithm"`: An integer, optional.
* `"digtype"`: An integer, optional.
* `"keytag"`: An integer, optional.

Extra properties in *DS info* objects are ignored when present in RPC method arguments, and never returned as part of RPC method results.


### Name server

Basic data type: object

Properties:

* `"ns"`: A *domain name*, required.
* `"ip"`: An IPv4 or IPv6 address, required.


### Priority

Basic data type: number

This parameter is any integer that will be used by The Zonemaster Backend Worker daemon to sort the test requests from highest to lowest priority.
This parameter will typically be used in a setup where a GUI will send requests to the Backend API and would like to get response as soon as possible while at the same time using the idle time for background batch testing.
The drawback of this setup will be that the GUI will have to wait for at least one background processing slot to become free (would be a few secods in a typical installation with up to 30 parallel zonemaster processes allowed)

### Queue

Basic data type: number

This parameter allows an optional separation of testing in the same database. The default value for the queue is 0. It is closely related to the *lock_on_queue* parameter of the [ZONEMASTER] section of the backend_config.ini file.
The typical use case for this parameter would be a setup with several separate Backends Worker daemons running on separate physical or virtual machines each one dedicated to a specific task, for example queue 0 for frontend tests and queue 1 dedicated to batch testing. Running several Backend Worker daemons on the same machine is currently not supported.


### Profile name

Basic data type: string

The name of a [*profile*](Architecture.md#profile).

One of the strings:

* `"default_profile"`
* `"test_profile_1"`
* `"test_profile_2"`

The `"test_profile_2"` *profile* is identical to `"default_profile"`.

>
> TODO: What is the expected behavior when a *profile* other than the ones listed above is requested?
>


### Progress percentage

Basic data type: number

An integer ranging from 0 (not started) to 100 (finished).


### Severity level

Basic data type: string

One of the strings (in order from least to most severe):

* `"DEBUG"`
* `"INFO"`
* `"NOTICE"`
* `"WARNING"`
* `"ERROR"`
* `"CRITICAL"`


### Test id

Basic data type: string

Each *test* has a unique *test id*.


### Test result

Basic data type: object

The object has three keys, `"module"`, `"message"` and `"level"`.

* `"module"`: a string. The *test module* that produced the result.
* `"message"`: a string. A human-readable *message* describing that particular result.
* `"level"`: a *severity level*. The severity of the message.

Sometimes additional keys are present.

* `"ns"`: a *domain name*. The name server used by the *test module*.

>
> TODO: Can other extra keys in addition to `"ns"` occur here? Can something be said
> about when each extra key is present?
>


### Timestamp

Basic data type: string

>
> TODO: Specify date format
>


### Translation language

Basic data type: string

* Any string starting with `"fr"` is interpreted as French.
* Any string starting with `"sv"` is interpreted as Swedish.
* Any other string is interpreted as English.

## API method: `validate_syntax`

Checks the `"params"` structure for syntax coherence. It is very strict on what
is allowed and what is not to avoid any SQL injection and cross site scripting
attempts. It also checks the domain name for syntax to ensure the domain name
seems to be a valid domain name and a test by the *ZOnemaster Engine* can be started.

Example request:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 143014426992009,
    "method": "validate_syntax",
    "params": {
        "domain": "zonemaster.net",
        "ipv6": 1,
        "ipv4": 1,
        "nameservers": [
            {
                "ns": "ns1.nic.fr",
                "ip": "1.2.3.4"
            },
            {
                "ns": "ns2.nic.fr",
                "ip": "192.134.4.1"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 143014426992009,
    "result": {
        "status": "ok",
        "message": "Syntax ok"
    }
}
```


#### `"params"`

An object with the following properties:

* `"domain"`: a *domain name*.
* `"ipv4"`: an optional `1`, `0`, `true` or `false`.
* `"ipv6"`: an optional `1`, `0`, `true` or `false`.
* `"ds_info"`: an optional list of *DS info* objects.
* `"nameservers"`: an optional list of objects each of *name server* objects.
* `"profile"`: an optional *profile name*.
* `"advanced"`: an optional `true` or `false`.
* `"client_id"`: ...
* `"client_version"`: ...
* `"user_ip"`: ...
* `"user_location_info"`: ...
* `"config"`: ...

If the `"nameservers"` key is _not_ set, a recursive query made by the
server to its locally configured resolver for NS records for the
value of the `"domain"` key must return a reply with at least one
resource record in the Answer Section.

At least one of `"ipv4"` and `"ipv6"` must be present and either `1` or `true`.
